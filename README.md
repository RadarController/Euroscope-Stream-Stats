Euroscope Stream Stats is a small plugin for Euroscope to generate the number of handled aircraft and number of presently assumed aircraft, and write them to a text file.

I (well, ChatGPT actually) wrote this so I could display the number of aircraft I'd worked in a session in my stream overlays, so it's very limited in function, is highly unlikely to be best practice, and therefore is for you to compile and use at your own risk.

However, if you want to extend it, improve it, or do anything else at all with it...please feel free.
